Sample files for testing BIGSTICK and its modalities.
These cases are in in the sd shell and use the Brown-Richter USDB interaction.
Sample outputs for comparison are found in the folder output.

a normal run + density matrices 

bigstick.x < input.mg25ref
compare to output/mg25ref.res

compute density matrices from the previous run

bigstick.x < input.mg25denfromwfn
compare to output/mg25dx.dres, output/mg25dx_dres.m  (Mathematica-compatible output)

compute an expectation value (of the original Hamiltonian) from a reference wfn

bigstick.x < input.mg25expectH
compare to output/mg25expectH.res

compute an alternate wavefunction and take the overlap

bigstick.x < input.mg25alt
compare to output/mg25alt.res  (also contains density matrices)
bigstick.x < input.mg25overlap
compare to output/overlap.dat

apply the spin operator (in sdspin.opme) to wave functions; needs mg25ref.wfn from running
input.mg25ref

bigstick.x < input.mg25apply1b

get a strength function distribution (will need to apply Clebsch-Gordans to get full B-values)
(Needs results from running input.mg25apply1b)

bigstick.x < input.mg25strength
compare to output/mg25spinstrength1.res
