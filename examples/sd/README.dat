Sample files for testing BIGSTICK and its modalities

a normal run + density matrices 

bigstick.x < input.mg25ref

a normal run + density matrices but with 2-body implemented as 3-body

bigstick.x < input.mg25ref3b

compute density matrices from the previous run

bigstick.x < input.mg25denfromwfn

compute an expectation value (of the original Hamiltonian) from a reference wfn

bigstick.x < input.mg25expectH

compute an alternate wavefunction and take the overlap

bigstick.x < input.mg25alt
bigstick.x < input.mg25overlap
