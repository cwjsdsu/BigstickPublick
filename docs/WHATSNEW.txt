WHAT'S NEW IN BIGSTICK IN VERSION...
7.8.1 (Aug-Nov 2017)
* Deleted restart option from menu.
* Commented out code to open .lvec files
* Added capability to read NuShell .sp files
* Added capability to use autoscaling from NuShell .int file
* Improved timing estimate.
* Fixed more bugs which arose in subsuming SPE.
* Fixed bug of reading in xpn files with truncations

7.8.0 (Aug 2017)
* Subsumed SPE operations into PP, NN, PN via (N-1)/(A-1); new file bsppot.f90
* Minor reordering of some calls etc to make sure new subsumation of SPE works correctly.
* Fixed bugs which arose in subsuming SPE. Tested MPI, OpenMP, and MPI-OpenMP

7.7.9 (July-Aug 2017)
* Made some changes, improvements in recording timing and other data
* Added description to INSIDE GUIDE on timing, output files.
* Changed position of output of bundletimes to avoid error message after density matrices.
* Added new output file 'timingdata.bigstick' which combines and subsumes most other 
  timing output files (bundletimes.bigstick, etc.)
* Added new output file 'distrodata.bigstick' which combines and subsumes several other
  distribution output files (opsdistro.bigstick etc.)

7.7.8 (May-July 2017)
* Modified the self-consistent mean-field option so it can write multiple vectors to file
* Added in 'tx' option for thick-restart to (approximately) target highly excited states;
for thick-restart added new convergence criteria, the rms of the beta's. This new option
works in MPI.

7.7.7 (Apr-May 2017 )
* Added option 'np' so can read in a predetermined pivot (such as from option 'f') with regular Lanczos
* In binput_tbme.f90, rewrote open_tbme_file -> tbme_menu for a (slightly) less kludgy routine
* Added routine to read in interactions in explicit proton-neutron format, with proton and neutron 
  spaces being the same
  New options are 'xpn' and 'upn' for explicit proton-neutron and unnormalized explicit proton-neutron

7.7.6 (Apr 2017  )
* Some comments added to breorthog.f90
* Put some common variables for lanczos into module lanczos_util in order to make transferring data easier
* Moving to clean up Lanczos algorithm making some defaults permanent
* SCMF option now working, still needs cleaning up.

7.7.5 (Dec 2016-March 2017)
* Fixed some timing for 'backwards' pp, pn, for better diagnoses
* Added capability to write out density matrices in p-n format
  even when running with good isospin
* Also can read in one-body operators to apply (option 'o') in p-n format

7.7.4 (Sept-Dec 2016)
* Shan fixed some minor bugs
* Installed option to read pivot vector for ordinary runs in preparation for HF
* Added file bscmf.f90 for routines for Hartree-Fock/selfconsistent mean field option
  (needs debugging however)
* Fixed timing for reorthogonalization
* introduced universal variables (bytesperXXjump etc) which record memory storage

7.7.3 (Aug 2016)
* Merged Hongzhang Shan's OpenMP threading for better efficiency; can be turned off by setting
   useHZSomp = .false.
* (Moved towards reinstalling Hartree-Fock reconditioner; still in progress)

7.7.2 (Aug 2016)
* Added new option 'b' to write basis info to a file for postprocessing
* Investigated # of haikus actually "used" in creating basis states
* Fixed exactdiag_p so that it works with density matrices.

7.7.1 (Aug 2016)
* Option 'dx' (density matrices from previously computed wavefunctions) now works in MPI, w/fragments
* Option 'v' (overlap/dot product) now works in MPI w/fragments

7.7.0 (July/Aug 2016)
* Fixed inline density matrices to work again  
* Minor rewrite to overlap routines to work with fragments (MUST TEST)
* Inline density matrices now work with MPI + fragments (but test more)
* More reorganization (mostly of parallel distribution routines).
  -- completely removed interfaces (including legacy file binterfaces.inc)

7.6.9: (July 2016)
* Reorganized basis files into specific tasks; in fact this had already been the case
but I put them in with a corresponding module

7.6.8: (July 2016)
* Introduced option 'ne' where only energies, no J, no T calculated or printed out
* Wrote/edited routines to finish distributing work for option 'o' apply 1-body operator
* Successfully (mostly) implemented targeted thick-restart so one can get highly excited states
  option 'tx' in Lanczos menu;  still need more testing
* Fixed overlap option 'v' which had been devalued under revision
* Option "o" (apply 1-body) should now work in MPI, including with fragments

7.6.7: (June 2016)
* delete module tribution in bmodules_parallel.f90, moved data to modules 
   fragments and operation_stats
* Fixed bug in density matrices (in reading in second wavefunction)
* Reorganized bdenslib and bapplyobslib2 files so as to gather similar routines
* Introduced new routines to apply one-body operators (now in bdenslib3.f90)
  These routines yield the same vectors up to 10-8, keep in mind however that
  Lanczos strength functions can yield intermediate results that appear different
  but with convergence these agree

7.6.6: (June 2016)
* Fixed bugs in improved OpenMP threading
* Edited MFD input routine in binput_tbme.f90 to be more robust
* Small edits to input/output (e.g., force 'lf' to be ONLY lanczos option for 
               strength function runs)
*Reorganized bwfnlib.f90 to group together like routines;
             renamed writeeigenvec_p -> wfn_writeeigenvec to be more consistent
*Rewrote routine "readpivot" so works (again) in MPI, including with fragments
*This means options 'x' (expectation values) and 's' (strength functions) work
  in MPI with fragments.


7.6.5: (May 2016) Ken improved OpenMP threading
*       Fixed various bugs in MPI on LLNL/Vulcan
* Dummy fragment size written to auto input files


7.6.3 (March 2016): Marching towards better initial pivot, preconditioner(s) for LOBPCG:
* improved documentation especially on main lanczos routine (which subroutines are called)
* added flags to module lanczos_info to limit application of opbundles
* added routines to compute/apply average pn diagonal within a sector  
* removed routine lanczos_master which was only called in the restart option
* modified main lanczos routine (lanczos_p) so that pivots are created outside it
* generated two options for initialzing pivot: see routine dynamic_vector_initializer

7.6.2 (February 2016):

7.6.1 (January 2016) :
* added a flag (iffulluseph) in module flagger to signal that, if a particle 
space is filled, to use p-h conjugation
* fixed a bug in p-h conjugation (did not correctly compute isospin if only 1 hole)
* added a flag to allow for automatic p-h conjugation when a particle space is filled; found
and fixed an associated bug (did not read in pn interactions and thus did not correctly compute 
effective s.p. energies)
* further fixed occupations with p-h conjugation so that filled shells show up as filled
* Added the ability to have separate W truncations on protons and neutrons as well as the sum

7.6.0 (December 2015): *  Fixed some minor bugs with particle-hole conjugation (specifically, with 
truncation, computation of isospin and density matrices could have errors. These had to do with 
BIGSTICK's automatic truncation of single particle spaces in some cases. Because we only use p-h
truncation in relatively small s.p. spaces, these were turned off).
* Also fixed particle occupation so it works correctly with particle-hole conjugation + truncations.
* Added a logfile, xxx.log, which records information such as standard flags, headers from input 
files, and so on. 
* Added bloglib.f90
* Deleted file bparallellib5.f90 with only obsolete files
* Deleted file bpreconditioner.f90 
* Added dlamc3.f to improve optimization cf KSM notes
